## This is a WIP. Things may break and may not work for everyone.
For those looking for the P5 Date and Weather widget, I will add that to the repo shortly along with other elements such as the main window and rotation code.


## DISCLAMER:
This program was created with only functionality on one system in mind without much concern for Optimization/Distribution. Please consider contributing to further improve it.

## Future Plans:
Users are able to create and load in their own widgets along with support for multiple distros.

## Tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04

The visualizer was made possible by @sbarratt 's spectrum-analyzer which is used for audio data capture.
